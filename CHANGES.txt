Visual Leak Detector (VLD) Version 0.9d

  Change Log / Release Notes

New Features/Changes:
---------------------

  Changes in Version 0.9d (30 March 2005)
  ---------------------------------------
  + This version of VLD brings with it some major changes to the way VLD
    interfaces with programs that use it. Instead of requiring that VLD be built
    from source and then linked with the application, VLD is now packaged as a
    pre-built static libaray. For those who just want to use VLD and are not
    interested in modifying the source, this eliminates the complexities of
    building VLD from source. A single header file, vld.h, has been added. To
    link with the static library, this header needs to be included in one of the
    program's source files. Please see the README.txt file for details on how
    these changes affect how to use Visual Leak Detector.

  + The Microsoft Debug Help Library (dbghelp.dll) version 6.3 is now included
    with the VLD distribution.


Bug Fixes:
----------

  Problems Fixed in Verson 0.9c (17 March 2005)
  ---------------------------------------------
  + Compile error, "error C2039: 'size' : is not a member of '_CrtMemBlockHeader'"
    occurs at line 644 of vld.cpp when building VLD with the VLD_MAX_DATA_DUMP
    preprocessor macro defined.


  Problems Fixed in Version 0.9b (15 March 2005)
  ----------------------------------------------
  + VLD fails to detect memory leaks in class constructors if the objects
    constructed are global objects.

  + If a debug executable is built with certain compiler optimizations turned on,
    specifically frame pointer omission optimization or automatic inlining, then
    theoretically VLD may produce incomplete or inaccurate stack traces or might
    fail to produce stack traces altogether.
