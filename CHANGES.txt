Visual Leak Detector (VLD) Version 0.9b

  Change Log / Release Notes

Problems fixed in Version 0.9b
------------------------------
+ VLD fails to detect memory leaks in class constructors if the objects
  constructed are global objects.

+ If a debug executable is built with certain compiler optimizations turned on,
  specifically frame pointer omission optimization or automatic inlining, then
  theoretically VLD may produce incomplete or inaccurate stack traces or might
  fail to produce stack traces altogether.
